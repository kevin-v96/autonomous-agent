# autonomous-agent
We have here a few autonomous agents built using LangChain, OpenAI API (GPT 4), and SerpAPI

The agents currently allow for a few different functionalities like:
- Search Wikipedia
- Look through and answer questions about an SQL database
- Calculate things
- Search Google and recursively ask itself questions to come up with an answer

This way, it can accomplish a lot of complicated tasks that a simple base LLM can't. 

### TO-DO
- [] Add Python files to run agent(s) from the terminal
- [] Add hosting via some platform like Streamlit, Gradio, etc.
